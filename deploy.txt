Running Your Rust-Based Earn Vault Application in WSL on Windows

Since your application is built using Rust and Actix Web, running it in WSL (Windows Subsystem for Linux) requires setting up Rust, SQLite, and necessary dependencies within WSL. Follow the steps below:


---

Step 1: Install WSL (If Not Installed)

If WSL is not installed on your Windows machine:

1. Open PowerShell as Administrator and run:

wsl --install


2. Restart your PC if prompted.


3. Open Windows Terminal and run:

wsl

This will launch Ubuntu or the default WSL distribution.




---

Step 2: Update WSL and Install Required Dependencies

Inside WSL, update your package list and install dependencies:

sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade -y
sudo apt install build-essential curl git libssl-dev pkg-config sqlite3 -y


---

Step 3: Install Rust

Rust is required to compile and run your application. Install it using Rustup:

curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh

After installation, restart your shell or run:

source $HOME/.cargo/env

Verify installation:

rustc --version
cargo --version


---

Step 4: Clone or Transfer Your Earn Vault Project

If your project is on GitHub, clone it inside WSL:

git clone https://github.com/your-username/earn_vault.git
cd earn_vault

Or, if the files are on Windows, move them into WSL:

1. Find your project path on Windows:

C:\Users\YourName\Documents\earn_vault


2. Move to WSL directory (/mnt/c/Users/YourName/Documents/earn_vault)

cd /mnt/c/Users/YourName/Documents/earn_vault




---

Step 5: Install Project Dependencies

Navigate to the project folder and install dependencies:

cargo build

If your project uses a database (SQLite, PostgreSQL, MySQL), ensure it's installed and set up:

sqlite3 database.db

Run migration scripts if applicable.


---

Step 6: Run the Application

Once everything is set, start the application:

cargo run

It should now be running on http://127.0.0.1:8080.


---

Step 7: Access Your Application from Windows

Since WSL runs in a virtualized Linux environment, access it using Windows Browser or Terminal:

1. In Windows Browser: Open

http://127.0.0.1:8080


2. Check Running Ports:

netstat -tulnp


3. Stop the Server (if needed):
Press CTRL + C in the terminal.




---

Step 8: Set Up Automatic Data Backup (Every 1 Hour)

Since you requested data backups every hour, add a cron job inside WSL:

1. Open the crontab editor:

crontab -e


2. Add this line at the bottom:

0 * * * * cp database.db backups/database_$(date +\%Y-\%m-\%d_\%H:\%M).db

This command backs up the SQLite database every hour into a backups/ directory.

You can modify it to back up JSON, logs, or other files.



3. Save and exit (CTRL + X, then Y, then ENTER).




---

Step 9: Run in Background (Optional)

If you want the server to keep running after closing WSL, use tmux or nohup:

tmux new -s earnvault
cargo run

Press CTRL + B, then D to detach.

To reconnect later, run:

tmux attach -t earnvault

Alternatively, use:

nohup cargo run > output.log 2>&1 &


---

Step 10: (Optional) Expose to Windows or External Devices

By default, WSL runs on localhost. If you want to access it from other devices on the network:

1. Edit main.rs to bind to all network interfaces:

.bind("0.0.0.0:8080")?


2. Find your WSL IP Address:

ip addr show eth0


3. Open the browser on Windows and enter:

http://WSL_IP:8080

That's it! ðŸŽ‰ Your Earn Vault application is now running in WSL!
